You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android.

I would Say Everything is fine, Top Performance, Nice Camera as Anyone would Expect from any series of iPhone but when the Question comes to Battery it is complicated. The Battery is fully optimised and it comes 3110 mAh capacity but the problem is with the charger. Honestly Apple Removed charger from in Box items in the name of Environment and they are also forcing us to buy any 20W PD 3rd par...  \n",

Loved it’s look! Soo glassy and classy. I would definitely recommend this model of Apple. Only disappointed with the 5W charger, one should purchase an 18W adapter for fast charging. Though battery backup is great. Bought it in September 2020, reviewing after so long so I’m gonna put the genuine review here.✅  \n",
